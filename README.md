# Installation Instructions

**NOTE: In order to install QuestCraft, you must have an internet connection in order for the inital setup to succeed. Furthermore, you MUST own a legal, valid copy of Minecraft: Java Edition to play!**

First off, you most likely want to install QuestCraft. Please go to the release page for **[QuestCraft](https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/QuestCraft/releases/latest)** and download the APK to your computer or Andorid device..

Secondly, you need to install the QuestCraft APK to your VR Headset using **[SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com)** and follow the necessary steps to connect your Quest. Drag and drop the APK, and wait for it to install.

Next, open the QuestCraft launcher on your headset. Be sure to grant it all requested permissions. Once complete, follow the on-screen prompts to enter your Minecraft login details and wait for QuestCraft to download any remaining files (seen in the bottom-right).

And boom! You have successfully installed QuestCraft on your VR headset! To play, simply press the **Play** button and wait for it to load, it might take a while depending on headset age and model.

## Some Recommended Settings and Tips 
1. In the options menu, go to VR Settings/Stereo Rendering and set the resolution (NOT CAMERA RES) to 80%. This will decrease the general quality, but will give an extra performance boost.
2. The game's render distance is best at 4. 5 works, but you may encounter lag spikes when using it. 6 and above, you are on your own.
3. Oceans contain LOTS of kelp that decrease framerate. Don't mine any of it all at once, as your game may CRASH if lots of entites (in this case, kelp waiting to be picked up) exist at once.
4. Skyblock and Oneblock worlds perform the best, as they require less hardware usage.
